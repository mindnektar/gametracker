By kicking off of planets, in some cases destroying them, Luna can propel herself through space in a specific direction, sometimes swayed by a planet's gravity. Kicking off a planet also causes any enemies on it to fly off its orbit, which can be used to destroy other obstacles. By collecting pieces of candy, Luna can create additional planets to help her navigate difficult sections.",
